# Covalence Formalization

This repository contains the formalization and design document for `covalence`, an experimental
LCF-style theorem prover for extensional Martin-LÃ¶f type theory.

The formalization is in Lean 4, and can be (after installing Lean) checked by cloning the repository
and running `lake build`.

The design document is written in Typst, and can be compiled with `typst c design.typ`.
